# STAT598_final_project

## Parts
Fairly self-explanitory:
There is the the folder called paper_implementation, which has the models that use CNNs using the paper's implementation (https://github.com/ZeWang95/ACDA)

There is another folder called re_implementation, which has my implemenation and models that use that.

No datasets are provided. You need to download your own. I use the CIFAR10 dataset and the Shanghaitech dataset.

There is also a folder called tools, which makes a dataset for the toy example.
